Description: Estimate meta-analytic age-specific risk of getting cancer (penetrance) due to pathogenic variants of a given gene by integrating information from studies reporting different
             types of risk measures on that particular gene. These risk measures include  age-specific penetrance, relative risk(RR), standard incidence ratio (SIR), and odds ratio (OR) .
